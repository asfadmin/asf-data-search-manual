Please use 'intersectsWith' instead. Bounding boxes define an area using two long/lat points. The Bounding box parameters are 4 comma-separated numbers: lower left longitude,latitude, and upper right longitude,latitude. This is a great choice for very wide search areas. Example: bbox=-150.2,65.0,-150.1,65.5 intersectsWith Search by polygon, a line segment (\u201clinestring\u201d), or a point defined in 2-D Well-Known Text (WKT). Each polygon must be explicitly closed, i.e. the first vertex and the last vertex of each listed polygon must be identical. Coordinate pairs for each vertex are in decimal degrees: longitude is followed by latitude. Notes: Does not support multi-polygon, multi-line or multi-point. Polygon holes are ignored This keyword also accepts a POST request Example ( Note: The spaces and parentheses below need to be URL encoded first ): intersectsWith=polygon((-119.543 37.925, -118.443 37.7421, -118.682 36.8525, -119.77 37.0352, -119.543 37.925 )) intersectsWith=linestring(-119.543 37.925, -118.443 37.7421) intersectsWith=point(-119.543, 37.925) Properly URL encoded: intersectsWith=point%28-119.543+37.925%29 polygon Deprecation Notice: This keyword will be deprecated.

Character Encoding: space replace with '%20'. Use '+' in keyword values ( replace with '%28' ) replace with '%29' For a complete list of URL codes, please see URL Encoding Reference . Escaping Characters If you are running Search API queries via command line, you may need to escape characters. Escaping a character tells the command line interface to interpret the character literally. Some characters that need to be escaped include spaces and ampersands (&). For more information on escaping characters, please see the Bash Scripting Guide . For Windows users, more information can be found here . Program Details You may use a program to assist you with Search API queries. This section will provide some details on a few of the programs you can use to write & run Search API queries and some example commands for each. aria2 Wget cURL Both Wget and cURL are often installed on Linux systems. cURL is part of the Mac OS, and Wget can be installed. Microsoft Windows OS does not come with either installed, but both can be downloaded. cURL is easier to set up on a Windows machine. aria2 can be installed on Windows, Mac, or Linux systems. Examples using aria2 aria2c can be used to download results from the Search API with a single command. You will need to include your Earthdata username and password, all desired keywords & values, and ensure that output=metalink.

It is reconstructed, unprocessed signal data with radiometric and geometric correction coefficients (appended, but not applied). L1.1 Products This product is generated from Single Look Complex (SLC) products equally spaced on slant range (equal to the spacing of sampling measurement), generated after rendering SAR processing to a level 1.0 product. These products are compressed in range and azimuth. Amplitude and phase information are preserved. Individual files are provided for each polarization for multi-polarization modes. L1.5 Products This product is generated from Multi-look amplitude images projected onto map coordinates (geo-referenced). This is rendered from SAR processing to level 1.0 products, and is acquired in single polarization high resolution mode. These products may be visualized without further processing. Individual files are provided for each polarization for multi-polarization modes. KMZ Products This product is a compressed file that includes a KML file and a color browse image (PNG) file. The KMZ can be uncompressed by changing the .kmz file extension to .zip and unzipping it. You may view the .kmz in Google Earth, or a similar program. Once unzipped, the .kml file can also be viewed in Google Earth. Opened in Google Earth, the file displays in an outline of the scene footprint on the Earth, and includes areas of no data, and a color browse of the geocorrected image in its correct orientation within the outline. The .png file is geocoded and rotated into projected space. Low-Res and Hi-Res Terrain Corrected Products The terrain correction products are generated for all FBS, FBD, and PLR beam modes, and include all available beam modes for dual-pol and qual-pol data. Any wide-beam data, as well as direct downlink direct source network (DSN) data, acquired by ASF at reduced resolution, are not terrain corrected. The terrain corrected products are derived from ALOS PALSAR Level 1.1 single look complex data, generated by the JAXA Sigma SAR processor (version 12.01) of the ALOS core software (release 6.07). RTC products are distributed at two resolutions. The hi-res products have a pixel size of 12.5m and are generated from high-resolution (NED13) and mid-resolution (SRTM 30m, NED1, and NED2) DEMs. The low-res products are generated at a 30m level for all available DEMs. All products are terrain corrected at the native pixel size of the DEM that is used for the correction. No additional resampling is required. All RTC products are geocoded to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and provided as floating-point power values in GeoTIFF format. The reference for the RTC products is pixel as point.

Any wide-beam data, as well as direct downlink direct source network (DSN) data, acquired by ASF at reduced resolution, are not terrain corrected. The terrain corrected products are derived from ALOS PALSAR Level 1.1 single look complex data, generated by the JAXA Sigma SAR processor (version 12.01) of the ALOS core software (release 6.07). RTC products are distributed at two resolutions. The hi-res products have a pixel size of 12.5m and are generated from high-resolution (NED13) and mid-resolution (SRTM 30m, NED1, and NED2) DEMs. The low-res products are generated at a 30m level for all available DEMs. All products are terrain corrected at the native pixel size of the DEM that is used for the correction. No additional resampling is required. All RTC products are geocoded to the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection and provided as floating-point power values in GeoTIFF format. The reference for the RTC products is pixel as point.","title":"Low-Res and Hi-Res Terrain Corrected Products"},{"location":"datasets/palsar/#further-reading","text":"DEM Information Level 1.0 Product Format Description Level 1.1/1.5 Product Format Description USGS ALOS PALSAR Radar Processing System What is a KMZ File?

Baseline uses information from two synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the same target area acquired at different times (temporal baseline) and from slightly different satellite orbit positions (perpendicular baseline). The Vertex baseline tool helps you identify and select scene pairs that are appropriate for Interferometric SAR (InSAR) processing. It provides visualization of perpendicular and temporal baseline data, and allows you to easily change the reference scene used in any stack. How to use Vertex Baseline Tool Visit ASF's Vertex to begin using the Baseline tool. Beginning your Baseline Search If you do not have a particular reference scene chosen, you can search for scenes using the geographic or list search. The center column will have a button under the metadata titled Baseline Tool for any scenes that are eligible. You may click this button to be directed to a Baseline search. The Baseline search will use the chosen scene as the reference scene. If you do have a particular reference scene chosen, you can select Baseline from the Search Type dropdown list. You may enter your reference scene and hit Search . Interacting with Baseline Search Results While in Baseline Search type, you will notice many familiar controls in the results panel. The scenes are shown in the left column. The perpendicular and temporal baselines are listed next to each scene. The center column lists the metadata for the selected scene, and includes the Set as Reference button, which allows you to set any scene in the stack as the reference scene. The Baseline Chart is shown in the right column. Result Panel Controls At the top left of the results panel, you will see the number of scenes listed. Zoom will Zoom to results magnifying the map area of the Earth where the scenes are located. Queue will Add all results to Downloads allowing you to add all scenes to the download queue.

SBAS is an acronym for short baseline subsets . It is a technique used in interferometry. The Vertex SBAS tool provides perpendicular and temporal baseline data, as well as scene pairs, for a chosen reference scene. What are some uses for SBAS? SBAS is widely used in the geosciences community. It works best for natural environments over a large scale and can be used to look at gradual change over time. SBAS requires input of a series of interferograms and the final output is a time series showing motion. One advantage of SBAS is that you are not restricted to a single interferogram. You can see gradual changes over time. It can also be useful for older datasets which sometimes have irregular acquisitions. The temporal and spatial filtering can help increase the accuracy for measuring deformation. You must choose which interferograms to use, which can require some experimentation. The Vertex SBAS tool simplifies this by providing good visualization and making it easier for you to quickly determine which scenes to use. There are other preferred approaches for urban environments, or higher resolution needs. However, regardless of your analysis needs, the SBAS tool is a useful overview tool and can also be used as a 2-D baseline plot. It gives a comprehensive, but rapid visualization of scenes. Further reading on baseline, including descriptions of multiple approaches, can be found here . A case study comparison of PS and SBAS can be found here . How to use Vertex SBAS Tool Visit ASF's Vertex to begin using the SBAS tool. Beginning your SBAS Search If you do not have a particular reference scene chosen, you can search for scenes using the geographic or list search. The center column will have a button under the metadata titled SBAS Tool for any scenes that are eligible. You may click this button to be directed to an SBAS search. The SBAS search will use the chosen scene as the reference scene. If you do have a particular reference scene chosen, you can select SBAS from the Search Type dropdown list. You may enter your reference scene and hit Search . Interacting with SBAS Search Results While in SBAS Search type, you will notice many familiar controls in the results panel. The pairs are shown in the left column. The center column lists the metadata for the two endpoints of the selected pair. The SBAS Chart is shown in the right column. Result Panel Controls At the top left of the results panel, you will see the number of pairs listed. Zoom will Zoom to results magnifying the map area of the Earth where the scenes are located. Queue will Add all to Downloads allowing you to add all scenes to the download queue. On Demand will allow you to Add all to On Demand queue to perform custom processing on the scenes. You may choose from RTC GAMMA , InSAR GAMMA , or autoRIFT , depending on your needs. RTC GAMMA processing is performed on the individual scenes in your result set. InSAR GAMMA and autoRIFT processing are performed on the pairs in your result set. Note: Currently, only scenes with beam mode IW are eligible for On Demand processing. Pairs will Download Pair CSV which lists the scenes in each pair and the download URL for each. It also includes the baseline values. In the left column, highlight the desired pair and click the On Demand icon to Add pair to On Demand queue . You may choose InSAR GAMMA or autoRIFT processing for each pair you wish to add. Chart Controls The dots on the chart represent individual scenes. Hovering over them will list their temporal and perpendicular information. The lines represent the pairs. You may use the mouse to navigate the chart. There are Zoom In and Zoom Out buttons located above the chart. The Zoom to Fit button will fit all of the pairs into the visible chart. You may click on any pair line in the chart. When you do, the selected pair is highlighted in red and the metadata for that pair is shown in the center column. You may adjust the temporal and perpendicular baseline using the sliders on the chart. You may also create your own pair if desired: Under Custom Pair , click the Plus symbol to Start adding custom pair . Click the dot on the chart representing the first scene. Click the dot on the chart representing the second scene. The new pair is created, and the pair detail is added to the bottom of the result list. Manually added pairs will be displayed with a dotted line on the chart. Note: You may also add custom pairs to the On Demand queue. If you wish to stop adding a pair after you have begun, you may click the Square symbol to Stop adding custom pair . If you wish to delete an added pair, you may click on the dotted pair line and click the Minus symbol to Remove custom pair . Note that only manually added pairs may be deleted. Click SBAS Criteria... for additional date filtering options. You may enter a Start or End date, or select dates on the calendar. Seasonal Search allows constraining the results to certain annual periods within an overall range of dates. Click the Seasonal Search toggle and additional options will appear, allowing you to adjust the sliders to specify a seasonal range ( Season Start Day/Season End Day ). Next Steps The next step is creating interferograms. You may do this through On Demand processing in Vertex. First, you would add some or all of the pairs to the On Demand queue as InSAR jobs. In the queue, there are limited options available for customizing your InSAR processing. You may also specify a project name. Submit the queue when you have selected all desired options. When the interferograms are completed, you can view and download them by using the On Demand Products search type in Vertex. For areas with glacial ice, autoRIFT is another processing option. Similar to InSAR, you would add some or all pairs to the On Demand queue as autoRIFT jobs. There are no additional customization options available for autoRIFT processing, however you can still specify a project name. When autoRIFT processing is completed, you can view and download the products by using the On Demand Products search type in Vertex. More detail can be found in the Vertex User Guide .
